See the top level README for information on connecting to the uart and
running programs.

From the memory map in the frescale reference manual and details in the
ARM Cortex-A9 Technical Reference Manual describing the global timer
registers.  This example displays the global timer registers in an
infinite loop.

Yes, that second number is a full 32 bit number and it is counting that
fast 4 billion individual counts in that register every 11 seconds give
or take.

From the arm docs the peripheral clock is used to feed this timer,
using a stopwatch the upper register changes about once every 11
seconds.  If it were 11 exactly then 2 to the power 32 or 4 gig
(0x100000000)/11 = 390MHz.  Not too shabby at all...

From some clues in the uboot boot output

CPU: Freescale i.MX6 family TO1.1 at 792 MHz
Thermal sensor with ratio = 182
Temperature:   41 C, calibration data 0x57e4eb69
mx6q pll1: 792MHz
mx6q pll2: 528MHz
mx6q pll3: 480MHz
mx6q pll8: 50MHz
ipg clock     : 66000000Hz

cspi clock    : 60000000Hz
ahb clock     : 132000000Hz
axi clock   : 198000000Hz

usdhc3 clock  : 198000000Hz
usdhc4 clock  : 198000000Hz
nfc clock     : 24000000Hz

We see 792MHz in a couple of places, half of that is 396 and we see
396 mentioned in one place.

If you take 2 to the power 32,  0x100000000 / 396000000 = 10.8 seconds,
so the 11 seconds using your eyes and a stopwatch is not bad.  The
peripheral clock driving this arm global timer is probably 396Mhz.  And
I would assume for now that the ARM is running at 792MHz.  Not bad
at all.
