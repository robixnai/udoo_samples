See the top level README for information on connecting to the uart and
running programs.

I experimentally determined which uart was used for the bootloader
console by using the memory write (mw) command on the bootloaders
command line.  Writing a character the different UTXD registers (and
resetting if/when that crashed).  Once you hit the right one, 0x21E8040
in this case, then you will see an extra character on the command line
along with the prompt.

MX6DL UDOO U-Boot > mw.l 0x21E8040 0x55
UMX6DL UDOO U-Boot > mw.l 0x21E8040 0x56
VMX6DL UDOO U-Boot >

Note the U and the V on the lines after the memory writes.

From there it was a simple matter of polling for RX having a character
and TX being ready for one.

This example prints a couple of things out in hex, then goes into an
infinite loop where what you type on the serial terminal is echoed back.
